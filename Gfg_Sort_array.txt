Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:
0 0 1
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort012() that takes an array arr and N as input parameters and sorts the array in-place.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 2










public class Gfg4 {
	 public static void sort012(int a[], int n)
	    {
	        // code here 
	        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
	            for(int j=i+1;j<a.length;j++){
	                if(a[i]>a[j]){
	                    int temp= a[i];
	                    a[i]=a[j];
	                    a[j]=temp;
	                    System.out.println(a[i]);
	                }
	            }
	        }
	    }
	 
public static void main(String [] args) {
	int ar[]= {0,2,1,2,0};
	sort012(ar,5);
}
}
